Features to Extract
Time-Domain Features:

Zero-Crossing Rate (ZCR): The rate at which the signal crosses the zero amplitude axis. Often used to detect percussive sounds.
Root Mean Square Energy (RMS): Measures the power or energy of the audio signal.

Frequency-Domain Features:

Spectral Centroid: Indicates the "center of mass" of the spectrum and correlates with the brightness of a sound.
Spectral Bandwidth: Measures the spread of frequencies in the signal.
Spectral Rolloff: The frequency below which a certain percentage (e.g., 85%) of the spectrum's energy is concentrated.
Spectral Contrast: The difference in amplitude between peaks and valleys in the spectrum.

Cepstral Features:

Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCCs): Widely used in audio classification; they summarize the power spectrum of the audio signal on a mel-scale.
Delta MFCCs: Temporal derivatives of MFCCs, capturing changes over time.
Delta-Delta MFCCs: Second-order derivatives.

Chroma Features:

Chroma Vector: Represents the energy distribution of the 12 pitch classes (e.g., C, C#, D) in the music.
Chroma CQT: Chroma features computed with constant-Q transform.

Rhythmic Features:
Tempo: Extracted using beat tracking algorithms.
Beat Features: Derived from beat intervals and rhythmic patterns.

Tonality and Pitch:
Key: Estimated tonal center of the music.
Harmonic-to-Noise Ratio (HNR): Measures harmonic structure.

Other Features:
Tonnetz: A representation of harmonic relations in music.
Onset Features: Detect where notes or beats occur.

1> Aggregating Features:

Compute mean, variance, and higher-order statistics for each feature to create fixed-size feature vectors.
Example:
Mean, standard deviation, and skewness of MFCCs.
Histogram of spectral rolloff or ZCR.

2> Data Augmentation (Optional but helpful):

Pitch Shifting: Slightly alter pitch to increase dataset variety.
Time Stretching: Speed up or slow down the audio.
Adding Noise: Introduce small amounts of noise to make the model robust.

3> Feature Fusion:

Combine features like MFCCs, chroma features, and tempo into a single feature vector.

Handling GTZAN's Issues
Repetitions: Filter out duplicate samples to avoid overfitting.
Mislabelings: Perform manual verification or use a subset of genres if needed.
Distortions: Consider preprocessing to mitigate distortions, such as noise reduction or equalization.
Tools for Experimentation
EDA and Visualization:
Use spectrograms (librosa.display.specshow) to visualize frequency content.
Compare distributions of features across genres using matplotlib or seaborn.
Machine Learning:
Experiment with models like SVMs, Random Forests, or Neural Networks for classification.
Try Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) on spectrogram images.
