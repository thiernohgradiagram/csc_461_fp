let's proceed with EDA to evaluate the quality of the extract features.

Summary Statistics: 
    Overview of feature distributions.

Class Balance:
    Distribution of genres (labels).

Class Separation: 
    Visualize feature separability using PCA or t-SNE.

Correlation Analysis (correlation between features):
    Detect redundant features using a correlation matrix.

Outlier Detection:
    Identify, visualize adn detect potential outliers in features.

Class-Feature Relationships:
    Examine how features vary across classes using violin plots or ANOVA.

Feature Importance:
    Train a simple model (e.g., Random Forest) to assess the importance of features.

Dimensionality Reduction:
    Visualize separability using t-SNE for better insights into non-linear separations.

After this analysis, weâ€™ll refine the feature set if necessary.

Dealing with outliers is an important step in preparing your dataset for machine learning. The approach depends on the context of your data, the machine learning model you plan to use, and how much the outliers impact your analysis.

Here are several strategies to handle outliers:

1. Remove Outliers
When to Use:

The outliers are due to errors, noise, or irrelevant data (e.g., sensor malfunctions or data entry mistakes).
Removing outliers does not compromise important variability in the data.
How to Implement:

python
Copy code
data_cleaned = data[
    (data[feature] >= lower_bound_iqr) & (data[feature] <= upper_bound_iqr)
]
This removes rows with outliers for each feature based on the IQR bounds.
2. Cap or Clip Outliers
When to Use:

You want to keep the outliers but reduce their impact by limiting their range.
Useful when the extreme values represent real phenomena but are rare.
How to Implement:

python
Copy code
data[feature] = np.clip(data[feature], lower_bound_iqr, upper_bound_iqr)
This caps values below the lower bound to the lower bound and values above the upper bound to the upper bound.
3. Transform Outliers
When to Use:

The data is highly skewed, and you want to reduce the influence of extreme values.
Common transformations include log, square root, and Box-Cox transformations.
How to Implement:

python
Copy code
data[feature] = np.log1p(data[feature])  # Log transform (add 1 to handle zeros)
4. Impute Outliers
When to Use:

The outliers are likely errors, and you want to replace them with a representative value (e.g., mean or median).
Suitable when removing outliers would result in significant data loss.
How to Implement:

python
Copy code
data.loc[data[feature] < lower_bound_iqr, feature] = data[feature].median()
data.loc[data[feature] > upper_bound_iqr, feature] = data[feature].median()
5. Model-Based Approaches
Use machine learning algorithms that are inherently robust to outliers, such as:

Tree-based models (e.g., Random Forest, Gradient Boosting).
Algorithms with regularization (e.g., Lasso, Ridge Regression).
Some algorithms (e.g., SVMs, Linear Regression) are sensitive to outliers, so preprocessing is crucial for them.

Best Practices
Understand Your Data:

Are the outliers valid data points, or are they errors?
Are the outliers relevant to your analysis or predictive modeling goals?
Experiment with Different Approaches:

Compare the impact of removing vs. capping vs. transforming outliers on your model's performance.
Automate Outlier Handling:

Create a function to handle outliers based on your chosen strategy.
